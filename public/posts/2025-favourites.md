2025 was filled with great memories with friends, family, and personal growth. I'm really looking forward to pushing myself further and making even more memories this year. My picks below reflect the interests that shaped my past year. A lot of the media wasn't necessarily released in 2025, but it's what I loved most. Including music, beauty products, and film. 

# Album: Submarine by The Marías

I've been listening to The Marías nonstop this past year. I first started listening to them in high school when they released *Cinema*, but my listening activity really exploded after  *Submarine*. Since then, they've consistently been one of my top artists. I mean, just check out my Spotify Wrapped below. Three of my top five songs are by The Marías.

# Makeup: Tower 28 Concealer

My everyday makeup routine is very simple. Especially on days when I wear my glasses, I usually stick to just concealer and powder. A huge non-negotiable for me, though, will always be concealer. I've stayed loyal to Tower 28 because it's safe for sensitive skin, isn't drying or greasy, and looks incredibly natural. If you're looking for a rec, this is it. 

# Skincare: Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen

Another absolute non-negotiable. I spent years trying to find the perfect Western sunscreen, when all along I needed to look East. I've tried other K-beauty sunscreens, but my love for this one is unwavering. I feel confident saying that I've finally found my skincare routine that truly works for me. 

This sunscreen blends into the skin effortlessly and, like the Tower 28 concealer, it's neither greasy nor drying. There's absolutely no white cast, and it doesn't irritate my skin. I highly recommend both of these products if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin.

# Hair: Mane Hot Thermal Round Brush

This is the thermal round brush I use for quick blowouts. I can style my hair in under twenty minutes now, which was completely unheard of just a couple of months ago. I used to let my hair air-dry or curl it on special occasions. But it was damaging and incredibly time-consuming. 

Now, I can quickly do my hair before heading out the door. It was easy to learn, and I have no concerns about burning myself.

# Movie: The Holdovers (2023)

![the holdovers](/images/the-holdovers.jpg)

A couple weeks ago, I hung out with a friend to bake and watch an xmas movie. We chose *The Holdovers*, and I completely forgot how good this is. It reminded me to reconnect with offline enjoyments. I jumped back into reading books, going on walks, working out, playing board games, and even ping pong with friends and family. 

I also recently watched *Avatar: Fire and Ash* (2025) with my family over winter break and really enjoyed it. Nothing comes close to *The Way of Water* (2022), but the visuals alone make it worth watching in theatres. Another recent fave is *Lost and Found (1996)*. It's set in 1990s Hong Kong, and the characters are strange and interesting. I mean, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Kelly Chen, and Michael Wong for two hours? Yes please. 

# Show: Better Call Saul (2015)

![better call saul](/images/better-call-saul.webp)

I stuck around for all six seasons of this show for Kim Wexler, and Kim Wexler only. Watching the rise and fall of Saul Goodman was entertaining too, don't get me wrong. But Kim was the central character for me. She's dimensional and compelling. 

It was honestly refreshing to watch a dominant female character who's career-driven and ruthless, yet still multi-faceted, funny, and kind. 

# Book: If I Had Your Face by Frances Cha

![if i had your face](/images/cha-novel.jpg)

*If I Had Your Face* follows several women whose stories intertwine. I really enjoyed reading its exploration of growing up, womanhood, beauty, and human connection. 

As for the rest of my reading this year, I can't say I have another standout favourite. I did finish *Emma* by Jane Austen and *My Body* by Emily Ratajkowski. Currently, I'm working through *A Room of One's Own* by Virginia Woolf, and I'm about to start *Anna Karenina* by Leo Tolstoy.
