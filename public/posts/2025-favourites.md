(intro blurb...)
A lot of the media wasn't necessarily released in 2025, but most loved. 

# Album: Submarine by The Marías

I've been listening to The Marias nonstop this past year. I started listening to them in high school when they just released Cinema, but my listening activity as exploded with them when the released Submarine. Since then, they have been one of my top artists. I mean, just check out my Spotify wrapped below. Three of my top five songs are by The Marias.

# Makeup: Tower 28 Concealer

My everyday makeup is very simple. Especially on days where I wear my glasses, I just stick to concealer and powder. A huge non-negotiable for me everyday though is always going to be concealer. I've stayed loyal to Tower 28's because it's safe for sensitive skin, isn't drying or greasy, and looks the most natural. If you're looking for a rec, here it is. 

# Skincare: Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen

Also another non-negotiable. I've spent so many years trying to find the perfect Western sunscreen, when all along I needed to look East. I've tried other K-beauty sunscreens, but my love for this one is unwavering. I feel confident in saying that I've found my perfect skincare routine and exactly what works. This sunscreen blends into skin easily and like the Tower 28 concealer, it's not greasy or drying. There's absolutely no white cast and doesn't irritate my skin. I highly recommend these two products above if you have sensitive and acne-prone skin.

# Hair: Mane Hot Thermal Round Brush

This is a thermal round brush that I use for quick blowouts. I can style my hair in under 20 minutes, which was completely unheard of just a couple months ago. I used to just leave my hair to air dry or curl it on special occasions. But it was damaging and so time consuming. Now I can quickly do my hair before I head out the door. It was also easy to learn and I have no concerns about burning myself.

# Movie: The Holdovers (2023)

![the holdovers](/images/the-holdovers.jpg)

A couple weeks ago I hung out with my friend to bake and watch an xmas movie. We chose The Holdovers and I completly fell back in love with this movie. It's not
