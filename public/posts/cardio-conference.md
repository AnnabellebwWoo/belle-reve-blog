I spent this past Saturday at the University of Toronto attending their annual Cardiovascular Disease Conference, hosted by UofT's Undergraduate Laboratory Medicine & Pathobiology Student Union. The event brought together eight speakers to discuss topics ranging from underlying biological mechanisms to how research advances from the lab to real-world treatments. 

Since photos and videos weren't permitted, I won't go into detail about the specific research presented. 

My highlight lectures were from Dr. Fish, Dr. Lee, and Dr. Radisic. 

**Dr. Jason Fish** 

*Is vascular damage at the heart of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction?*

Dr. Fish discussed the cardiovascular side effects of cancer treatments. 

**Dr. Warren Lee**

*LDL Transcytosis: Atherosclerosis by a thousand cuts*

This talk focused on the process of LDL transcytosis through endothelial cells and explored potential methods for interrupting or reversing the process. 

**Dr. Milica Radisic**

*Immune cells and vasculature in engineered heart tissues*

Dr. Radisic's lecture highlighted the role of tissue engineering in cardiovascular disease research, including her well-known work in organ-on-a-chip engineering.

As a Materials Engineering student, this conference was particularly enriching as it fell outside the scope of my typical coursework. I was exposed to new perspectives on the intersection of materials science and medicine. 

I highly recommend attending conferences, symposiums, and events at other universities if you're a student. Overall, it was a well-spent Saturday, and I can't wait to see more advancements in this field!
