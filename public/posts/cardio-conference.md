I spent this past Saturday at the University of Toronto attending their annual Cardiovascular Disease Conference, hosted by UofT's Undergraduate Laboratory Medicine & Pathobiology Student Union. The event brought together eight speakers to discuss the underlining biological mechanisms to how research is advanced from the lab to real-world treatments. 

Since photos and videos weren't permitted, I won't go into detail about the specific research presented. 

My highlight lectures were Dr. Fish, Dr. Lee, and Dr. Radisic. 

**Dr. Jason Fish** 

*Is vascular damage at the heart of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction?*


**Dr. Warren Lee**

*LDL Transcytosis: Atherosclerosis by a thousand cuts*


**Dr. Milica Radisic**

*Immune cells and vasculature in engineered heart tissues*


As a materials engineering student, ...

I highly recommend checking out other conferences, symposiums, and events hosted at other universities if you're a student. I had a great experience learning about something that I wouldn't normally learn in Materials Engineering. Overall it was an enriching, well-spent Saturday, and I can't wait to see more advancements in this field!
