These books have been on my reading list for a while, and I'm so glad to finally have my hands on them. I got them all on [book outlet](https://bookoutlet.ca/), which is a Canadian book retailer that sells at a discounted price on account of excess inventory, store returns, or minor imperfections. 

# maid and class, Stephanie Land

I've been dying to read *maid* since watching the Netflix series in 2021. I can't wait to read more on Land's story and what didn't make it to the screens. 

# Eating Animals, Jonathan Safran Foer

I've always heard great things about *Eating Animals*, especially when I first got interested in going veggie. I kind of forgot about it for a while, but in all honesty, I've been utterly obsessed with Alex Honnold this past week. He's generally plant-based and also recommended this book. That really pushed me to pick up this book once and for all. I've been veggie for a while and have experimented with going vegan, but I'm interested in learning about the full consequences of eating animals.

# bonjour tristesse, Françoise Sagan

Although this was on my reading list, I don't quite remember what influenced me to add it. It looks like a great light read for commutes, and I'm still looking forward to it. 

# Didion & Babitz, Lili Anolik

I've seen this cover floating around on my social media explore pages. I haven't gotten into any actual Didion and Babitz writing, but I'll start with this for now.

# Still Bobbi, Bobbi Brown

I really admire Brown for creating a beauty empire, and I can't wait to learn about her journey and the lessons she learned along the way.
